## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University from Connecticut, with a minor in China and Asia-Pacific Studies. I’m interested in aerospace and space systems, and I enjoy using modeling, simulation, and hands-on prototyping to turn messy real-world constraints into designs that are simple, testable, and effective. I’m especially drawn to problems where fundamentals (mechanics, fluids, heat transfer) connect directly to performance, and where iteration and testing are part of the engineering process.
