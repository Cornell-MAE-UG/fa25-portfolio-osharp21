#### Experience
- **Lockheed Martin – Rotary & Mission Systems**, Liverpool, NY  
  *Systems Engineering Intern* | June–August 2025  
  - Supported radar regression testing and data-collection events; improved test procedures and checklists for clarity and repeatability  
  - Built/maintained analysis tools for radar data (bug fixes, automated summaries, visuals) to speed up troubleshooting and anomaly identification

- **Sensata Technologies**, Attleboro, MA  
  *Mechanical Design Intern* | June–August 2024  
  - Designed and prototyped an EV battery component to improve current-carrying performance and reduce cost  
  - Created SolidWorks CAD and built a test rig to capture temperature and electrical resistance data for 24 prototypes simultaneously  
  - Analyzed test data and performed structural analysis to guide design changes; produced BOMs, cost estimates, and technical deliverables for review

- **Avedisian Fuel Combustion Lab (Cornell University)**, Ithaca, NY  
  *Research Assistant* | January–May 2024  
  - Reinforced experimental apparatus for repeated high-impact testing supporting microgravity combustion studies  
  - Investigated soot formation in droplet combustion; collected data supporting peer-reviewed publication work
