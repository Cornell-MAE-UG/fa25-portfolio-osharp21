## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a minor in China and Asia-Pacific Studies. I’m interested in mechanical and aerospace engineering, especially aircraft and space-related systems, and I like work that blends modeling with hands-on design. I’m drawn to projects where solid fundamentals and iteration lead to a clean, testable solution.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
